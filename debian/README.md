# Home Assistant Step By Step Easy Install + Ansible Playbooks

:warning: Using Debian 11 and following a strict set of guidelines available HERE 4.2k will give you an officially supported installation of Home Assistant Supervised. If you choose at anytime to install additional software to the Debian operating system, your installation may become officially unsupported.

:warning: If you do not understand what this means, or that making almost any changes to the underlying OS may render your install Unsupported/Unhealthy, this installation method is not for you and you should install HA OS. If you do not require the supervisor, then installing HA Container 1.0k may be a better option and will allow you full control over the OS to install additional software and Docker containers.

If you are new to Home Assistant, you can now proceed to Section 1 if you need assistance with installing Debian 11. If you already have Debian 11 installed and wish to move on to installing Home Assistant, move on to Section 2.

Section 1 â€“ Install Debian

1.1) Start by downloading debian-live-11.2.0-amd64-standard.iso from HERE 4.1k. If you would prefer the full Debain image with all drivers, download firmware-11.2.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso HERE 622

1.2) While Debian is downloading, you will need some other programs to help with the setup and installation. To burn the Debian ISO image to a USB thumb drive, you will use a program called Rufus which can be downloaded from HERE 990.
